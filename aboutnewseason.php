For the first time since 2011, Chris Paul will not be on the roster as he was traded to the Houston Rockets in the off-season in exchange for a bevy of players, a first round pick next year, and cash. Head coach Doc Rivers would also relinquish his role as a President of Basketball Operations for the team on August 4, with the role being replaced by Lawrence Frank.</p>
